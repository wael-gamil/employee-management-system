# Employee Management System - Vue 3 Frontend

> **🤖 AI-Powered Development Challenge**: This comprehensive Employee Management System was built entirely through AI-assisted development as a challenge to test whether AI could create a production-grade frontend system in Vue.js without prior Vue experience (developer background: React). The project was completed under tight deadline constraints, demonstrating AI's capability to deliver complex, feature-rich applications.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This is a full-featured Employee Management System built with Vue 3, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. The system provides comprehensive CRUD operations for companies, departments, employees, and projects, along with advanced features like role-based access control, real-time notifications, reporting, and much more.

| **HR Manager** | ✅ View | ✅ Full | ✅ Full | ✅ View | ✅ View | ❌ None |
| **Project Manager** | ✅ View | ✅ View | ✅ View | ✅ Full | ✅ View | ❌ None |
| **Employee** | ✅ View | ✅ View Own | ✅ View | ✅ View Assigned | ❌ None | ❌ None |
| **Viewer** | ✅ View | ✅ View | ✅ View | ✅ View | ✅ View | ❌ None |

### **16+ Granular Permissions**
